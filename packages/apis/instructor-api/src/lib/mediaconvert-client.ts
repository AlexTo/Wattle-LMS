/**
 * Submits a MediaConvert job transcoding a just-uploaded video into HLS.
 * Called from createContentItemVideo/updateContentItemVideo only after the
 * DynamoDB record they write has been created/updated, so the completion
 * callback that later patches that record can never fire first. Returns the
 * new job's id so the caller can stamp it onto that same record --
 * transcode-complete.ts uses it to ignore a stale completion event from a
 * job a later replacement has since superseded.
 *
 * `submissionNonce` becomes MediaConvert's `ClientRequestToken`. It's the
 * caller's own durable record of "is this the same submission attempt as
 * before" (see content-item-video.ts), not a fingerprint of the uploaded
 * file -- a caller retrying this exact mutation after a crash (e.g. the
 * process died after this function returned but before the caller could
 * stamp the job id onto its record) passes back the *same* nonce it
 * already persisted, so CreateJob recognizes the token it already handled
 * and returns the existing job instead of starting a redundant one. A
 * genuinely new submission always gets a fresh nonce from the caller, so
 * it can never collide with anything, no matter how much time has passed
 * or how identical the uploaded content happens to be to something past.
 * (An earlier version derived this token from the raw upload's S3 ETag
 * instead -- abandoned because MediaConvert's own token-reuse window
 * turned out to be far less bounded in practice than documented, so a
 * coincidental content match could dedupe onto an unrelated, long-dead
 * job. The nonce sidesteps that entirely by never depending on content.)
